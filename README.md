Test Bed Project #1
----------------------------
This is a project started as a nameless, idealess testbed project to help me attempt to learn Unity and object oriented programming as a whole.
It exists as a snapshot of my progress in learning, and a theme idea came across after the second or third day of development, so it technically
is no longer an idealess testbed, merely a nameless one. What I do with this project remains to be seen, but it likely will not be the last.
